This package is for portal implementation wrappers that do security
checked access to public methods in portlet classes.</p>
<p>
Due to the current implementation of additional interfaces for portlets, we
must have different wrappers depending on:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>plain</em> Portlet</li>
<li>Portlet implements PortletState interface</li>
<li>Portlet implements Cacheable interface</li>
<li>Portlet implements both interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>The "consumer" of these classes (currently the PortletFactoryService) MUST
ensure that the proper wrapper is used. A way to achive this while centralizing
this (dirty) code is to use
<code>return PortletWrapper.wrap( portlet )</code> when returning a portlet.
